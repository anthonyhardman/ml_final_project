# Math 3480 Final Project

Welcome to Anthony Hardman's Final Project for Math 3480. This project is a culmination of the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the course.

## Data Source

The data used for this project was sourced from the [Kaggle NLP Getting Started Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/data). The specific file used for analysis is `train.csv`.

## Project Structure

- `fp.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains all the calculations and visualizations for the project.
- `train.csv`: This is the dataset used for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and model creation.
- `requirements.txt`: This file lists all the Python packages that were used in this project.
- `paper.pdf`: This file contains my write up for this project.

## Setup & Installation

This project was developed using Python 3.12, but it should work with other recent versions of Python as well.

To install the required Python packages, navigate to the root directory of this project in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
